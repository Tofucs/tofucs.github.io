# Hi! I'm Andrew Hu

I'm a current sophomore at Cornell University studying computer science. Recently I've been working on video game end-to-end with a team of 8 for Cornell's introduction to game development course(CS 3152). It's called Dreamwalker, and its a stealth platformer with hints of combat. It'll be published on Steam after the showcase on May 17th. I've also been working on building an autonomous robot to clean beaches as a lead developer on the Cornell Nexus project team--mainly developing ROS2 code and the robot architecture, along with some PID and path planning stuff.

tofucs stands for tofu and then cs. tofu because I really like mapo tofu (thanks mom) and cs because I played a lot of counter-strike when I was younger, actually. now it sorta means comp sci for obvious reasons.
